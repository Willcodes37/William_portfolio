# US Debt Tracker Project

## Overview
The US Debt Tracker Project is designed to analyze and visualize historical trends and projections of U.S. public debt. This project examines debt data from 1993 to 2023 and provides insights into yearly changes, monthly historical patterns, and projections for publicly held debt. It serves as a comprehensive tool for understanding the dynamics of U.S. national debt.
